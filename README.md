# A New Way to Lend
*"Credit is generally overpriced and unfairly distributed, because it relies on techniques developed before the advent of modern computing. But technology and data science, in the form of AI, have the opportunity to change all of that." - Paul Gu, Co-Founder*

## Overview and Origin
Founded in April of 2012, this company wanted to remedy a loan origination process that felt obsolete and too FICO focused.  After graduating Yale University, Paul Gu was unable to find a lender that was willing to assist him in his debts.  Although he may not have had a perfect credit score or a home as collateral, he did have a bright future and the ability to pay a loan.  There was an obvious disconnect with lending and current consumer needs.
With no personal lending changes in decades and an urge to treat borrowers as more than just a number, founders and ex-google employees, Dave Girouard, Paul Gu and Anna Counselman, set out to make waves in the lending industry.  
Upstart began with an initial seed money of 1.5 million, then was granted another 6 million from series A.  As of 2019, Upstart has raised a total of 160 million from different investors.

## Business Activities
Upstart began as a company in search for a solution to loans for students that came directly out of college.  With roughly 70% of college graduates in debt, there is a high demand for debt consolidation and personal loans.

However, lenders at the time were charging 22% on average to students who were trying to pay off debt.  Low interest loans were difficult for recent graduates to receive, due to their lack of credit history and lack of collateral.  Even at the higher interest rate, lenders were not approving personal loans very quickly due to their underwriting and approval processes.  To add to these frustrations, many borrowers were getting declined due to their credit worthiness.

Upstart wanted to bridge the gap of a highly FICO oriented environment of lending and the consumer whose qualities surpass that of a score.  They also wanted to streamline the process and create a quick turnaround time for their approval process. Upstarts systems accounted for unique variables (such as education and employment backgrounds) that other lenders were not considering as a basis for loan approval.  

Upstart developed an AI program to determine if loan applicants were good candidates and were able to offer loans at an interest rate about 10% less than other personal loans available to individuals.  They were also able to approve a larger range of applicants who may not have qualified in traditional lending spheres.


Upstart requires applications, utilities, devops and many business tools to run their business.  They utilize jQuery for their JavaScript library, Cloudflare to host their website and for website security. Bootstrap is utilized for their framework as well as their website development.   These are only a few of the technologies they are currently utilizing. 


## Landscape:

Upstart is a personal finance company which focuses on lending.  

Personal loans have traditionally been dominated by retail banking institutions.  However, in the last few years, many large banks stopped offering personal loans as the loan amounts and processing times were not making them profitable.  With the rise of technology and AI systems, approval processes are not as labor intensive and have become profitable again.  Companies began utilizing an online platform for loan originations at a lower cost, making the domain extremely competitive with multiple options for customers.  Customers now are flocking to online options for their debt relief.

Some competitor online companies in this domain are companies such as Sofi and LendingClub.  Every company has their own spin on personal loans.  For example, SoFi offers many products, but personal loans with no origination fees and payment protection in case of a lost job.  LendingClub is a very cookie cutter lender which focuses on speed and efficiency. With dozens of online lenders currently, we are still hard pressed to find a company as innovative in this sphere as Upstart.

## Results

When looking at companies in this domain and field, the core metrics of success is profitability which comes in more loans approved, with less loans defaulted.  Profitability also is impacted by how aggressive their interest rates are which makes borrowers more inclined to borrow from that company.

From the date founded, Upstart has funded 6.9 billion with 58% of those loans fully automated.  However, they trend even better within the last 5 years, with Upstart with 3.3 billion in loans funded and as of 2019 60% of their loans were automated and approved immediately.  Also, within the last 5 years, Upstart has been able to demonstrate that their loss rate is less than 50% of big bank competitors.  

Upstart has also been able to approve 27% more borrowers than its competitors at a 17% lower interest rate. Through an internal study, they have also been able to cite 75% fewer defaults at the same approval rate or 173% more approval rate at the same loss. 


Since its inception, they have grown to become more than a lending company.  Upstart has begun partnering with banks utilizing their success yielding platform.  Banks that choose to utilize their service are improving their profitability margin drastically.  They are giving the customers a better experience through the same streamlined process, lowering their risk and driving growth for the banks.


## Recommendations

It’s time to branch out!  Upstart has had proven success in their business model and their creative loan origination process can be expanded to more than personal loans.  Maybe it’s time mortgages and business loans were less FICO focused as well.

A product such as a mortgage loan that can help home buyers who may not traditionally qualify, or would qualify at too high of a rate, would attract many clients.  Utilizing their current methods along side actual collateral would be industry changing.

They could partner up with real estate fintech companies to provide a streamlined service and better loans than some of the largest banks.
